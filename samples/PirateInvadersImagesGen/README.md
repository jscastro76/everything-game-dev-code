# PirateInvadersImagesGen

`PirateInvadersImagesGen` is a Codex-focused variant of `samples/PirateInvaders`.

It keeps the original Phaser gameplay and structure, but replaces the runtime-generated
placeholder textures with raster assets generated through Codex `$imagegen` and copied into
the sample workspace.

## What this sample proves

- Codex-generated PNG assets can replace procedural placeholder graphics in a real scaffold sample.
- The accepted outputs can move from `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...` into the repository and become project assets.
- The game can preserve the same texture keys and almost all gameplay code while swapping the visual pipeline.

## Asset workflow used

1. Start from the existing `PirateInvaders` sample.
2. Clone it into `PirateInvadersImagesGen`.
3. Generate raster assets with Codex `$imagegen`.
4. Copy the accepted images into `public/assets/images/`.
5. Preload those assets in `BootScene`.
6. Preserve the original texture keys (`player`, `sloop`, `button`, etc.) so the rest of the game logic stays stable.
7. Apply fixed display sizes in code so gameplay does not depend on the generated image dimensions.
8. Track the accepted assets in `generated-assets.json` and validate them with `node ../../scripts/validate-generated-assets.js`.

## Run

```bash
cd samples/PirateInvadersImagesGen
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
cd samples/PirateInvadersImagesGen
npm run build
```

## Notes

- `src/utils/GeneratedAssetConfig.js` is the small integration layer for image-based assets.
- `generated-assets.json` is the acceptance contract for transparency, display size, and body size.
- `src/utils/AssetGenerator.js` remains from the original sample as historical context, but this variant does not use it at runtime.
- This is intentionally a sample-sized workflow: it demonstrates how `$imagegen` integrates into the scaffold without introducing engine-specific editor tooling.
