# Samples

Complete, playable games generated entirely by the `/full-game` command from this scaffold. No manual coding involved — each game was produced end-to-end from a single natural-language prompt.

These samples demonstrate the scaffold's ability to take a game idea and deliver a fully wired project with gameplay, UI, audio, and assets.

## PirateInvadersImagesGen

**Genre:** 2D Arcade Shooter (Space Invaders variant)
**Platform:** Web (HTML5 — Phaser 3)
**Features:** Same gameplay as `PirateInvaders`, but with gameplay and UI raster assets generated through Codex `$imagegen`

This sample exists as a scaffold integration demo: it keeps the original texture keys and gameplay logic, swaps procedural runtime textures for generated image assets, and shows how to persist accepted outputs inside the workspace.
