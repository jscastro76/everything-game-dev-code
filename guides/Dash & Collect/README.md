# Dash & Collect — Unity Game Guide (0 to 100)

A complete walkthrough for building a 2D endless runner using the **everything-game-dev-code** scaffold from concept to post-launch.

---

## Game Concept

**Dash & Collect** is a 2D side-scrolling endless runner.

- The player's character auto-runs forward
- Tap or press a button to jump over obstacles
- Collect coins for bonus score
- Game ends on obstacle collision
- Speed increases over time

**Design pillars:** instant restart, satisfying jump, escalating tension.

**Scope:** main menu, gameplay scene, game-over screen, local high-score, basic audio.

## How to Use This Guide

Each chapter maps a game development phase to the scaffold features that support it.
You do not need a running Unity project to follow along — every chapter includes example
outputs (GDD excerpts, TDD excerpts, test plans) so the scaffold workflow is clear without
running Unity.

**Read order:** Start at Chapter 0 if you are new to the scaffold. Jump to any chapter if
you already know the basics and want to see how a specific phase works.
