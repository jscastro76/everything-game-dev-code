# Agent / Skill Matrix

This matrix defines which skill groups each agent should reach for first. It is not a hard lock, but it is the default routing map for consistent delegation.

## How to Use This Matrix
- Start with the agent's primary skill set.
- Pull adjacent skills only when the task crosses boundaries.
- Escalate to `planner`, `producer`, or `technical-design-lead` when a task spans multiple domains or changes project-level decisions.
- Use engine-specific skill groups only when the implementation is explicitly inside Unity, Unreal, or Godot.

## Routing Rules
- If a task changes player-facing goals, route through the relevant design agent before engineering finalization.
- If a task changes architecture, persistence, networking, or build strategy, route through `technical-design-lead` or `architect`.
- If a task affects milestone risk, scope, compliance, or launch readiness, route through `producer`, `qa-lead`, or `release-manager`.
- If a task is implementation-only inside one engine, prefer the matching engine reviewer or build resolver.
