# commands/

Commands are the preferred entry points for work in this scaffold. Each command defines a specific task, the conditions under which it applies, and which agents it invokes. Starting work through a command ensures the right roles are activated and the right standards are applied.

## What commands do

A command is a structured task trigger. When you invoke a command:

- the purpose and scope of the task are declared upfront
- the correct agents are activated for that task type
- engine isolation is preserved — engine-scoped commands only invoke engine-scoped agents
- the output format and quality bar are defined in advance

Commands do not replace judgment. They channel it.

### Build and fix

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/unity-build-fix` | Diagnose and resolve Unity build failures |
| `/unreal-build-fix` | Diagnose and resolve Unreal build failures |
| `/godot-build-fix` | Diagnose and resolve Godot build failures |

### Testing and quality

### Performance and optimization

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/perf-budget` | Define or review performance budgets for a platform target |
| `/memory-budget` | Define or review memory budgets and allocation patterns |

### Release and live operations

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/release-check` | Run the full release readiness checklist |
| `/patch-notes` | Generate structured patch notes from recent changes |
| `/liveops-brief` | Plan a live ops event, update, or seasonal content drop |
| `/telemetry-plan` | Define instrumentation strategy and event taxonomy |

### Maintenance and documentation

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/refactor-clean` | Identify and remove dead code or structural debt |
| `/update-docs` | Sync source-of-truth documents with current implementation |
| `/verify` | Run the full scaffold validation suite |

### Orchestration

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/orchestrate` | Coordinate a multi-agent workflow across a complex task |

## How to invoke a command

Prefix the command name with `/` when directing the agent:

```
/plan add a combo system to the combat loop
/unity-review Assets/Scripts/Combat/
/release-check build 1.2.0
```

For engine-specific commands, the active engine profile must match the command family. Running `/unity-review` on a Godot project will produce incorrect guidance.
